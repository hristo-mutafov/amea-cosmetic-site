                        The purpose of trichopigmentation is to create an
                        optical illusion of hair presence where there is none.
                        The procedure is also an adequate solution for problems
                        and conditions related to hair loss (alopecia areata,
                        androgenetic alopecia, alopecia universalis, general
                        thinning), as well as for concealing scars after hair
                        transplantation (generic scars on the scalp, FUT linear
                        scars, FUE dot scars).

                        Hair is an important characteristic, but various factors
                        can worsen it over time. Everything from genetics to
                        stress can lead to unwanted hair thinning, hair loss, or
                        similar issues. Fortunately, there are many solutions to
                        combat this.

                        Trichopigmentation is a temporary, "tattoo-like"
                        experience where a trained professional creates the
                        illusion of hair follicles on a person's scalp using
                        specialized pigments and a specialized micro-needle.
                        Unlike its permanent counterpart, SMP (scalp
                        micropigmentation), trichopigmentation can last between

                        For example, a man in his younger years may decide that

                        design trends in hairstyles, like those popular among
                        celebrities such as Drake. But this trend may not be
                        what he needs in later years. Regardless, SMP will not
                        disappear, and he will be stuck with the same hairline
                        for at least the next 6 years, and even after that, it
                        will begin to fade but still remain.

                            the cause has been resolved. Trichopigmentation can
                            provide a temporary way to enhance the appearance of
                            thick hair during these scenarios.

                                This type of tricopigmentation can make an area

                        To achieve 100% effectiveness from tricopigmentation,
                        three sessions are required, with a 30-day interval
                        between each session. The first tricopigmentation
                        session can last from one to three hours, depending on
                        the level of hair loss and the areas being treated. The
                        second session may take only two hours. The third
                        session may take less or the same amount of time. It all
                        depends on the density of the pigmentation, the speed of
                        work, and the area being treated.

                    <p class="text">
                        After the third session, follow-up maintenance is
                        performed every 6 to 18 months, depending on the

                        pigmentation and improves the appearance of the spots.
                        Typically, it will take less than two hours to complete
                        the maintenance procedure.

                        No. In most cases, tricopigmentation does not cause

                        particularly sensitive to pain due to other medical
                        reasons, such as previous surgeries or health
                        conditions. If necessary, special local anesthetics are
                        used during the procedure to make the process completely
                        painless.

                    <p class="text">
                        The patient should also take into account that in some

                        to consider the maintenance schedule on an individual
                        basis. The patient should pay attention when the
                        tricopigmentation points start to fade. When this
                        happens, the patient should consider scheduling an
                        appointment. Sometimes this may occur earlier than a
                        year. In other cases, the appearance of the points made
                        during the initial tricopigmentation procedure will
                        remain visible for a longer period.

                        Maintenance will not be necessary if the patient no
                        longer wishes to maintain the look achieved through the
                        tricopigmentation procedure. If this is the case, the
                        patient can simply wait for the points made during the
                        procedure to fade away.

                        The prices for tricopigmentation are variable, as it is
                        necessary to consider how many areas need to be treated,
                        and most importantly, the density of the areas. An area
                        completely free of hair is different from an area that
                        already has a certain density. The best way to find out
                        what the cost will be for you is to contact me to
                        schedule your consultation, where we will discuss your
